## Thumbnails

Click on any thumbnail in the grid to display the full image along with its title and an optional form to add a description. If choosing to add a description, type it into the form and click the 'Save Description' button. This description will be stored on your machine locally and reappear when you re-select that thumbnail. This will also take you back to the grid of all thumbnails. If you choose not to add a description you can also return to the home grid by clicking on the 'Back to All Thumbnails' button.
